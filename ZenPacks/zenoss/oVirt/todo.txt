TODO
----
* Update XML files to specify searchIcon, icon
* Get better icons for everything
* Make the oVirt datasource testable
* Support both HTTP **AND** HTTPS w/ certs
* Needs better error handling in the modeler code
* Needs better error handling in the events daemon
* If possible, abstract out the communications code so that it can be re-used in multiple places (eg modeler, event reader, datasource 'test' method, perf collector)
