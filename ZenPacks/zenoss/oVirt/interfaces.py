# In Zenoss 3 we mistakenly mapped TextLine to Zope's multi-line text
# equivalent and Text to Zope's single-line text equivalent. This was
# backwards so we flipped their meanings in Zenoss 4. The following block of
# code allows the ZenPack to work properly in Zenoss 3 and 4.

# Until backwards compatibility with Zenoss 3 is no longer desired for your
# ZenPack it is recommended that you use "SingleLineText" and "MultiLineText"
# instead of schema.TextLine or schema.Text.
